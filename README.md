# Memact Interface

Version: `v0.0`

Interface is the user-facing Memact app.

Tagline:

```text
Connect the Dots.
```

The product is simple:

```text
Enter a thought -> see how it connects with what you read, watch, search, and revisit.
```

Memact is not a generic search box. It uses the user's own local digital activity: pages, posts, videos, searches, and revisits saved by Capture.

Memact is built for better decision making. It helps users:

- See what sources may have shaped a thought.
- Spot one-sided views before acting on them.
- Understand emotions that may be tied to externally influenced thoughts.
- Revisit the real context behind an idea instead of relying on memory alone.

## How It Works

```text
Capture -> Inference -> Schema -> Interface -> Influence / Origin
```

- `Capture` saves useful digital activity.
- `Inference` turns that activity into cleaner meaning.
- `Schema` notices repeated themes.
- `Interface` lets the user enter a thought.
- `Influence` shows what may have shaped the thought over time.
- `Origin` finds possible source candidates that may have introduced it.

The app should stay honest. It shows source candidates and patterns, not proof of causation.

## Local OCR Policy

Capture first uses normal page text, structured page regions, and PDF extraction. Local OCR is only a fallback when a page has weak extractable text.

- It runs locally in the browser when the platform exposes a local text detector.
- It does not upload screenshots or OCR text to an external service.
- It is gated by idle state, weak-text checks, and per-URL cooldowns to reduce battery impact.
- It stores OCR output only as part of the same local event record used by Memact search.
