# Memact Website

Version: `v0.0`

Memact helps you see where your thoughts may be coming from.

You type a thought.
Memact looks at what you read, watch, search, and revisit.
Then it shows links that may have shaped that thought.

Why this matters:

- it can help you catch one-sided thinking
- it can help you make better decisions
- it can help you understand why some thoughts or feelings keep showing up
- it can help you explain your ideas more clearly

## How Memact Works

```text
Capture -> Inference -> Schema -> Website -> Influence / Origin
```

- `Capture`
  Saves useful activity from your device.
- `Inference`
  Finds the main meaning in that activity.
- `Schema`
  Notices patterns that keep repeating.
- `Website`
  Lets you type a thought and see the result.
- `Influence`
  Shows what may have shaped the thought over time.
- `Origin`
  Shows what may have first introduced the thought.

## Infrastructure Contract

Website is only one Memact client.
The same backend shape should also work for Android and later API explanations.

The shared contract lives here:

```text
docs/platform-contract.md
```

The important rule is simple:
AI can help explain the wording later, but the evidence must already come from deterministic Memact engines.

## First-Time Setup

Memact does not interrupt the user right away.
Setup starts when the user first tries to use search.

If Capture is not installed yet:

1. Download the extension zip.
2. Unzip it into a folder.
3. Open `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
4. Turn on Developer Mode.
5. Click `Load unpacked`.
6. Pick the unzipped folder.

After that, Memact can ask to import some recent activity from this device so it does not start empty.

- If the user allows it, Memact starts building first suggestions.
- If the user skips it, Memact waits for new activity from then on.
- If the user changes their mind later, the `Settings` button lets them turn local import on.

Website does not keep its own extension source code.
Capture is the only extension codebase.
Website only serves the packaged zip that comes from Capture.

## Run Locally

You need:

- Node.js `20+`
- npm `10+`

Install:

```powershell
npm install
```

Run:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Build:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Preview:

```powershell
npm run preview
```

## Extension Zip

Build the extension in Capture first:

```powershell
cd ..\capture
npm install
npm run package-extension
```

Then sync that packaged zip into Website:

```powershell
cd ..\interface
npm run sync-capture-zip
```

The website then serves that same packaged zip here:

```text
public/memact-extension.zip
```

## Search Setup

The website already includes the main Google search basics:

- canonical URL
- `robots.txt`
- `sitemap.xml`
- search metadata
- structured data
- favicon and web manifest

One thing still has to be done by the real site owner:
Google Search Console verification.

After verification, the normal next steps are:

1. Submit `https://www.memact.com/sitemap.xml`
2. Inspect `https://www.memact.com/`
3. Request indexing if needed
